# Archive

This directory preserves historical material related to the project.

It contains earlier drafts, exploratory notes, experiments, diagrams, and intermediate ideas that led to the current canonical framework.

Nothing in this folder is part of the active specification, simulation, or protocol.

The archive exists for provenance, auditability, and historical continuity only.
